I've been using Terminator for years now and it's perfect for my needs.
 Ever since I installed it, I have never looked back. Using 0.8 transparency so I can see whatever I have opened under it, 
 green text on a dark background because that makes me feel like a h4x0r of course,
 and ZSH shell because it's awesome. Irreplaceable combination.
