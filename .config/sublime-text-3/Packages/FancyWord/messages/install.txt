This plugin helps you pick fancy word in your writing, it also provides a build-in dictionay.

You just need put your cursor behind the word you want to replace, and hit CMD K + F.

There are two dictionary within: Word2Vec, Wordnet.

Wordnet is enabled by default, it takes 11 MB space on disk.

Word2Vec needs you to prepare some required files, but it also suggests much fancier words.

Word2Vec is disable by default, if you wanna give it a shot, you need:

1. install gensim: `pip install gensim flask-restful`

2. Download pretrained Word2Vec model, you can download [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz8u16o5sSTxSzVYVThGdUQ4Mjg) or [here](https://cdn.eastonlee.com/deps.words.bin), or you can find proper ones for yourself, but notice that pretrained model should be compatible with Gensim and be binary form.

3. After you download pretrained model, enable Word2Vec in FancyWord.sublime-settings, and specify model file location in FancyWord.sublime-settings, and your Python executable absolute path.

4. Restart SublimeText 3
