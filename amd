### Reddit post (DEFUNCT DRAFT)


Intel is now facing:
*Meltdown Performance fiasco
*Multiple Lawsuits
*Zen 2 After a couple of months, while they can't make a release without fixing their hardware first
*Ryzen have 4 MORE threads at cheaper price NOW
*Intel ME problems popup every couple of weeks

So sincerely now AMD
   Just get a solid Zen 2 release
   And **Open source PSP**

I am not talking Gaming right now, Sorry gammers

I am talking small cloud vendors, small businesses, programmers, Open source people, Linux users.
I realise these may seem a small market, but they can drive HUGE salles
